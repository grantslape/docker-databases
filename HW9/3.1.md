# PostgreSQL: Sales Data Again
This project was basically the same as Chapter 2, but in PostgreSQL.    
Project 3  (Oracle or your second DBMS)
Do both (a) and (b)

(a)   Practice to use Oracle 
   Using Oracle to create 5 tables and insert values 
   to the 5 tables from (Figure 2-6 Retail Sales Database.)
 
   Turn in  the printout of all 5 tables with your name on the first
   page and marked “Project 3”.
    
   
b)  Using Oracle to Execute at least 8  non-trivial SQL 
queries for the database including grouping (2), subquery (2),
Cross Join (1), implicit Join (1) and explicit Join (2).
Make sure your SQL should not be identical to those in the book.

Use English statements to explain each query. 

For each query:
Display English statements for the query before the SQL query 
Statement, and then display the executed outputs.

(c) Print out E/R model like Fig 2-4. (Same as Project 3)

Each English query statement should NOT be more than 3 lines.
  Turn in  the printout with your name on the first page and 
  marked “Project 3”.
