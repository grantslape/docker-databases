# MySQL: Sales Data

This project was to practice creating tables and inserting values to those tables:

>1.	Download free the My-SQL with Php (window only) from the instructions in the attachment in this e-mail.
(You may use your own DBMS choice.)
2.	Practice to use MY SQL.                         
                           Using MySQL and PHP to create 3 tables and insert values 
                           to the 3 tables from (Figure 2-5 Retail Sales Database.)
3.	Always mark the DBMS you used for the project. There will be a 5% penalty if there is no DBMS marking or no project # marking.
There will be 10 % penalty if no your-name specified.
4.	Turn in the  printout of all 3 tables with your name on the first
                           page and marked  “Project 1”.
